======================

Wallpaper slideshow utility for multi-monitor setups on Windows.  
The Visual Studio solution is hella messy so you should probably not use it.  
Depends on CImg: http://cimg.sourceforge.net  

Enter paths to your images in Folders.txt.  
Timer.txt structure:
- Resolution of your monitors in a (width)(linebreak)(height) format  
- 'endmonitor'  
- Whether or not you want to keep a history of used wallpapers (1 or 0)  
- Time between wallpaper changes in seconds.  

ive been using this for nearly a year and it's still a hacky mess

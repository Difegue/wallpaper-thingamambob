======================

Wallpaper slideshow utility for multi-monitor setups on Windows.  
The Visual Studio solution is hella messy so you should probably not use it.  

Enter paths to your images in Folders.txt.  
Enter the resolution to your monitors in Timer.txt, separated by linebreaks (hella ugly but w/e)  
After 'endmonitor', input 1 and the time between wallpaper changes in seconds.  

ive been using this for nearly a year and it's still a hacky mess
